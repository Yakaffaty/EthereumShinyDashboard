# Analyzing the Ethereum Blockchain 

In this proyecto we utilized the R, Shiny, BigQuery and Kaggle in order to create a dashboard with the most relevant data in an actual timed manner. Our aim was to demonstrate the interactions inside the blockchain by doing queries inside it with the help of the BigQuery Tool. This project connects to the BigQuery API in order to show real-time data on the graphics.

## Installation

For the Installation you must fulfill the requirements by R in order to view the application in local. The actual app is a Shiny App. In order to run the project you must import the RData if you wish to see it local or update the credentials to you BigQuery API in order to grab the data through there. 

For the actual run you should just press play in the Shiny App once you have the server and ui imported into your environment. No other run necessary.

## Usage

Press play and watch the magic happen. If you wish to alter the dates of the analysis you may do so with the tools on the left of the launched application. All of the queries are inside the server so if you wish to alter a graph or the data being recollected you can change it there.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
